# CakePHP Menu Plugin

[![License](https://poser.pugx.org/dereuromark/cakephp-menu/license.svg)](https://packagist.org/packages/dereuromark/cakephp-menu)

A powerful menu builder for CakePHP apps.

**WORK IN PROGRESS!**

**DON'T USE THIS IN PRODUCTION!**

This branch is for CakePHP 4.0+.

## Features

We've tried to keep this as agnostic as possible to third party libraries

* Interface to set your logic for implementing when an item is active
* Interface to set your logic for implementing when an item is visible or not
* Rendering is completely decoupled from the data structure of the menu
* Following PSR7 while at the same time providing CakePHP convenience wrappers
